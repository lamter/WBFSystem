This is a skeleton of business flow system based on web.py and Redis. It affords a user management function.

The structure is:

	 |-doc
	 |-licenses
	 |-redis
	 |-sh
	 |-requirements
	 |-unitest_web
	 |-www
	 |---app
	 |-----controllers
	 |-----models
	 |-----tools
	 |-----bridge
	 |-----views
	 |---lib
	 |---log
	 |---public
	 |-----css
	 |-----img
	 |-----js
	 |---static
	 |-----css
	 |-----cs
	 |-----img
	 |-----js
	 |---test
	 |---tmp


- **doc**: Documentation of the project.
- **licenses**: Project license or any other licenses used by 3rd party libraries go here.
- **reids**: A redis-server which can be run directly.
- **requirements**: Mandatory Python libraries to install with pip.
- **sh**: Bash script files of the project.
- **unitest_web**: Unitest for all modle.
- **www**: Project's www folder.

		- **controllers**: Handlers of the application. Each `{name}_handler` is a module.
		- **models**: Models of the application.
		- **bridge**: Here goes the services that connects with another services (such as a socket server running on Java).
		- **tools**: These are libraries which are dependent to application.
